Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorized or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.
Any handling of personal information authorized or required by law will take priority over this Privacy Policy to the extent of any inconsistency.
